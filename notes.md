Sources

Main sources:

-   **Designing Social Systems in a Changing World**
-   System Design of Education
-   Developing a systems view of education the systems-model approach
-   The search for meaningful reform: A third-wave educational system

I also had a quick look at:

-   Dialogue as a means of collective communication
-   Dialogue as a collective means of design conversation

Summary
=======

\"First, the book aims at guiding the reader to understand what systems
design is, how it works, why we need it.

The second purpose is to develop an appreciation of the power we can
gain by acquiring ever-unfolding competence in system design.\"

Change
======

\"Before we engage in the design of our lives and our systems, we need
to reflect on how we ourselves relate to change.\"

-   Reactive
-   Inactive
-   Preactive (ride the tide)
-   Interactive (shoot the rapids)

\"The future depends more \'on what we do between now and then than it
does on what has happened until now.\'\"

Curtis 1982: stages of development
==================================

(Cf. Ray and Joe\'s paper.)

-   STAGE ONE spanned over half a million years.
    -   (Consciousness, speech)
-   STAGE TWO emerged about ten thousand years ago.
    -   (Agriculture, writing)
-   STAGE THREE started five hundred years ago.
    -   (Science, Print)
-   \"STAGE FOUR is our current evolutionary stage.\"

Education and society
=====================

\"We can say that EDUCATION AND THE SOCIETY ARE IN A CO-EVOLUTIONARY
RELATIONSHIP.\"

\"The education we offer reflects perceptions and practices based on the
societal image of the industrial age.\"

\"On the other hand, when a new image leads socio-cultural evolution, it
can exert -- as Polak (1973) called it -- a \'magnetic pull\' toward the
future.\"

Image

\"You see things as they are and ask: WHY? But I dream things that never
were and ask: WHY NOT?\" (George Bernard Shaw)

\"Staying within the frame of reference of the existing system and
focusing on its problems hinders the RE-IMAGING of education.\"

\"rather than asking lots of questions about what is wrong with our
existing system... we should dream of kinds of education that never were
and make the dream come true by design.\"

DESIGN IS FUTURE CREATING AND NOT FUTURE GUESSING.
==================================================

\"In education it means taking responsibility for designing systems ...
that enable and empower future generations to direct their own lives and
shape their own destiny.\"

Levels, Scope, Patterns of Interaction
--------------------------------------

``` {.text}
Learning experience  Existing system            Information exchange
Instruction          Issues in the environment  Cooperation         
Administration       Community                  Coordination        
Governance           Larger Society             Integration         
```

\"The GOVERNANCE LEVEL is in focus when the purpose of education is
indoctrination and enculturation. Top decision makers (in the government
or in religious institutions) define policies and regulations, and
mandate uniform curriculum and instruction.\"

\"INTEGRATION is the most intensive and the highest form of
inter-organizational arrangement of creating systemic relationships. If
integration were to be considered, the entity that we now call school
might become a component of a community-wide system of learning and
human development.\"

Example
=======

The image reflects focus on the learning-experience level with
arrangements made in the environment of the learner by which the learner
is enabled to fully realize his or her potential as an individual and as
a participating and productive member of the society.

Vitruvius
=========

\"The science of the architect depends upon many disciplines and various
apprenticeships which are carried out in other arts,\" and \"technology
sets forth and explains things wrought in accordance with technical
skills and methods.\"

Jumping Mouse
=============

The mouse left the well-known home ground and, encouraged by the frog,
dared to jump high (transcending) and capture the image of the sacred
mountains (envisioning). He then embarked on an arduous journey (the
design journey), during which he had to give up his sight (leaving the
past behind) in order to be guided to the top of the sacred mountain,
where he became transformed into an eagle (the transformation phase of
design).

Bridge\'s transition
====================

We have to let go of the old reality, the old setting, the old thinking.
The first step is \"letting go,\" leaving behind and transcending. The
second step is envisioning what should become... which happens in a
\"neutral zone\" of creativity, renewal, and design. Then comes the
third step, the transition into the new reality (transformation by
design).

Transition details
==================

-   \"Mark the endings\"
-   \"Treat the past with respect\"
-   \"Let people take a piece of the old way with them\"
-   \"Show how endings ensure continuity of what really matters\"

Appendix
========

\"This article describes a general approach and a specific strategy for
effecting the needed structural changes, and, also describes some
initial progress on implementing that strategy.\"

The major structural aspects of our present system include:

-   group learning
-   constant rotation
-   time-based grade levels
-   isolation
-   administrative organization

\"Many solutions that are initially thought of as unworkable under
current constraints, are in fact workable... much better results are
achieved by initially thinking in the ideal.\"
